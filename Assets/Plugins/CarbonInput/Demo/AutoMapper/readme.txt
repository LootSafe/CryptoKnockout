This scene is not a real demo scene, but instead a useful tool for generating new mappings.
If you have a gamepad with a more or less typical layout and there is no mapping for it, this scene can help you generating a new mapping. 
Start the scene and press the highlighted buttons on your gamepad. To match the axes, just move your thumbsticks indicated in the scene. 
After all buttons/axes are mapped, the scene will create a new mapping in the Assets/ folder. 
Now move that mapping to any Resources/Mappings/ folder inside your project, like the one inside the CarbonInput folder.
